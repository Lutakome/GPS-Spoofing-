# **GPS-Spoofing**-
The proliferation of commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) has revolutionized industries like precision agriculture and disaster response. However, their significant reliance on global positioning system (GPS) for navigation exposes them to malicious GPS spoofing attacks. 

GPS spoofing is an attempt to manipulate a GPS receiver by broadcasting manipulated signals. The results of a successful GPS spoofing attack can have extreme consequences with respect to the safety of the mission, equipment, payload, infrastructure and most importantly human lives. 

Various methods have been introduced to detect GPS spoofing; however, most methods require expensive hardware. In this paper we propose machine learning algorithms to detect GPS spoofed signals. In comparison to other proposed algorithms, XGBOOST reveals its superiority in performance using precision, recall and F1-Score as benchmarks; with a precision of 85.41\%, recall of 86.91\% and F1-Score of 86.14\%. Other models, including random forest had a precision performance of 79.60\%, recall performance of 79.80\% and F1-Score of 79.70\%; decision tree classifier had a precision of 84.04\%, recall of 84.53\% and an F1-Score of 84.28\%; and logistic regression had a recall of 25.00\%, recall of 27.21\% and F1-Score of 21.93\%, exhibiting varying degrees of performance. Computational efficiency and scalability are emphasized, ensuring the framework's suitability for resource-constrained UAV deployments. 


# Background and Motivation
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are used in a variety of fields of study, including the military, civil defence, border surveillance, traffic management,meteorology, firefighting, agriculture (to spread pesticides in crops), and people-finding, as shown in figure 1. A bird's eye perspective that can be used almost anywhere and at any time is now available to drone users. As a result, the market for UAVs has grown significantly, and it is predicted that it will reach USD 102.38 billion by 2030 (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Drones Market Size 2022-2030. 2022), see (appendix A). Furthermore, technical improvements have made it possible to operate small drones with a smartphone rather than remote controllers.

# Significance of the Study
As seen in figure 2, spoofing attack carries the greatestweight of all the cybersecurity. Once a spoofing attack is successful, the attacker is command, and the 3 data integrity is breeched. Commercial unmanned aerial vehicles are systems that are under order based on the application of the end user. Their usage is on the rise, but the security is still in question as most of the manufactures never take into consideration the privacy and protection settings.

# Archictecture of the Attacks
In order to navigate and control themselves accurately, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) significantly rely on GPS signals. However, spoofing attacks, in which malicious actors trick UAVs with false GPS signals, can disrupt operations and grant unauthorised access to restricted airspace and pose a risk to safety. Commercial UAVs likewise rely on a centralised system, as shown in figures 3 and 4 respectively, making it simple for an attacker to shoot them down.
